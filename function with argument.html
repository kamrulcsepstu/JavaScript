		//sometimes, we need to pass some values to our function
		//how can we do that??
		//lets see
		function myFun(arg1){
			console.log("You have passed " + arg1);
		}
		//here, we have crated a function named myFun with an argument
		//we have set a command to show the output with the passed value in the function
		//lets call our function first.
		myFun("Hello");
		//that means if we want to pass any value to our function then  we can do it simply.
		//now the question is "can we pass more than one values?"
		//lets check it right now
		myFun("Hello", "World!");
		//oh!! we are not getting our expected output!
		//so whats wrong??
		//we have made a mistake here.
		//and that is we declared that we have only one argument when we created our function
		//but we are trying to pass two arguments!
		//so its illogical to see the two passed values in output
		//then how can we do that?
		//lets see
		function myFun2(arg1, arg2){
			console.log("You have passed " + arg1 + " and " + arg2);
		}
		myFun2("Hello", "World!!");
		//we can pass any number of values in this way.
