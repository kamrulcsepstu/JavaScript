		//lets create a variable

		//we can assign the value of variable

		name = "Kamrul";

		//the variable(name) is now holding the value(Kamrul);
		//we can now use this variable in any place of our program when we need it.
		//for example i am going to show you the value of the declared variable as alert.

		alert("Hello " +name +" !!");

		/*we can hold any type of values in variables. In many programming languages (i.e. C,Java etc) 
		we need to declare the data type of the variable and then hold the values.But in JavaScript, we 
		never need to declare the variable types. We can use javascript variables to hold any type of data.*/

		//we can declare multiple javascript variables in a single line.
		//to do that we need to separate the variables by comma like below

		var name, id, reg_number, faculty;

		name = "Kamrul";
		id = 1502025;

		alert("The name of the student is " +name + ". " + "His ID number is " +id + ". " +"His Registration mumber is " +reg_number + "." + "He is a student of faculty of " +faculty +".");

		//we can use console.log() to see the output of the variables in the console
