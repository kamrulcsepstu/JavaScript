		//we have set a command to show an output in console
		//if we run our page now then we will not see any output

		//that means a function in javascript is a procedure by which we can do some predefined task!
		//functions do not affect our code unless we call it
		//if we call it more than once, what will happen??
		//lets check!
		myFun();
		myFun();
		//oops! thats working too!
		//that means function can be called in any number of times if we want
		//it also means that we can call it anywhere of our program.
