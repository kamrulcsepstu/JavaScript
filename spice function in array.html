		//splice() function is used to remove any of the items from an array.
		//so first lets create an array
		//then we will remove its elements from anywhere of the array
		var myArray = ["Kamrul", "Hasan", 1502025, '06213', "CSE", "PSTU"];

		//lets see the output now.
		console.log(myArray);

		//cool!! now lets use the splice() function
		myArray.splice(2,1);

		//lets check what is changed!!
		console.log(myArray);

		//oops!!! the third element of the array is removed!!!
		//spice(2,1) is our  used function. 
		//here 2 means the third element
		//but what is the meaning of 1 here??
		//lets check by putting 2 replacing 1 in splice() function
		myArray.splice(1,2);

		//lets see what happened!!!
		console.log(myArray);

		//wow!! second and third elements of the array are removed!!!
		//that means that 2 is the number of items to remove
		//and the 1 is the position of the element from which removing data will be started!!
